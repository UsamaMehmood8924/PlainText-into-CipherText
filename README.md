# PlainText-into-CipherText
This code will convert plain text into cipher text when a key is entered i.e. a special 3x3 matrix

Firstly, the user is asked to enter a key to encrypt the plain text into cipher text. So, the user enter the numerical elements of 3x3 matrix.

Thus, the supposed key will be of the form:<br>
1 2 3 <br>
8 6 4 <br>
2 5 9 <br>

Then user enter the message to encrypt. For Example the message is "HELLOWORLD". <br>
The cipher text generated by this code when the user enter above key and plain text will be "WUDBAEDYEQU". <br>
